## Background:
### When the new crown pneumonia virus was raging, I stumbled across an app full of design wisdom when I was bored at home, so I was willing to spend some time to share my feelings and design ideas about this interesting app Analyze even the computer knowledge it contains. I believe this app can bring me more interesting and bold ideas when I am about to enter the third year of college.
